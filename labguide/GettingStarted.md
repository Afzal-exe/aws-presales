# Access Guidelines for Sandbox Environments

Before starting your testing activities, kindly note that the **lab duration** will be displayed at the top right corner of your lab environment page once you click the **Launch Lab** button. The timer will start automatically, so please keep track of your remaining time while working in the sandbox.

> **Note:**
> The sandbox environment is configured primarily for the **US-EAST-1 (N. Virginia)** region.
> Some services may not be available or may fail to deploy in other regions, so always ensure you are operating within **US-EAST-1** unless explicitly instructed otherwise
